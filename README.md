Welcome to a complete, AI-powered fashion ecosystem designed to redefine how we discover, design, and experience clothing. This project goes far beyond a simple virtual dressing room, integrating a suite of intelligent, interactive features that put the user in control of their personal style.

Our journey began by mastering a series of progressively sophisticated virtual try-on architectures, including VITON-GAN, CP-VTON, VITON-HD, HR-VITON, and the diffusion-based Ladi-VTON. This foundational work gave us an unparalleled understanding of realistic cloth rendering and deformation, which we then used as a launchpad for a much broader vision.

âœ¨ Key Features
This platform is a multi-faceted tool that empowers users at every stage of their fashion journey.

1. The Intelligent Discovery Engine
Imagine a fashion boutique that reads your mind. Our discovery engine uses OpenAI's CLIP model to understand fashion on a human level, allowing for lightning-fast, intuitive searching.

Search by Text: Go beyond simple keywords. Describe an aestheticâ€”"an elegant black gown"â€”and CLIP's text encoder translates your desire into a vector, instantly retrieving items that match the vibe.

Search by Image: Upload a photo of an outfit you love. CLIP's image encoder analyzes its visual DNA and surfaces visually similar pieces from our collection.

Multi-Modal Search: Where true creative control begins. Love a pattern but want it on a different item? Upload an image and add text like "...as a bomber jacket." Our system fuses the visual style with your prompt, while a weighting slider gives you full control over the final, precise results.

2. The Creative Director's Canvas
Ever wished you could be the designer? Now you can. This feature turns your imagination into photorealistic fashion with no design skills needed.

Find a Base Item: Search for a piece of clothing to use as your canvas.

Paint Your Vision: The selected item loads into an interactive canvas. Using a digital brush, simply paint over the area you want to change.

Describe the Dream: In a simple text box, describe your modificationâ€”"embroider a golden dragon here." We even enhance your prompt with keywords like "masterpiece" to guide the AI.

Generate & Discover: The Stable Diffusion Inpainting model takes your base image, the painted mask, and the prompt, generating a completely new design in seconds. We then use CLIP to find real-world items that look just like your new creation!

3. From Doodle to Dress: Sketch-to-Cloth
Unleash your inner artist! Grab your mouse or stylus and draw a rough sketch of a clothing item. Our system analyzes the shapes and lines of your drawing, converting it into a sophisticated embedding. It then scours our database to find real clothing items that match your unique, hand-drawn vision.

ðŸš€ Repository Guide & How to Run
This repository contains the core notebooks that power our entire ecosystem. Hereâ€™s a guide to what each file does:

recommendations.ipynb - The All-in-One Feature Hub
This is the main interactive notebook. It contains the complete, integrated implementation of all our user-facing features:

Text, Image, and Multi-Modal Search: The complete discovery engine powered by CLIP.

The Creative Director: The full pipeline using Stable Diffusion Inpainting for AI-powered design.

Sketch-to-Cloth: The implementation of our sketch-based search functionality.

ladi viton.ipynb - Ladi-VTON (GMM Training)
This notebook contains the code for training the Geometric Matching Module (GMM) for our diffusion-based try-on model. This is the first crucial stage that learns to warp clothing realistically.

notebookc74383c19d.ipynb - HR-VITON (TOCG Training)
This notebook documents the intensive training process for the Try-On Condition Generator (TOCG), a key component of the HR-VITON architecture.

Note: Training this model is computationally expensive and took approximately 24 hours on Kaggle GPUs to achieve satisfactory results, highlighting the complexity of state-of-the-art models.

hd viton.ipynb - VITON-HD (Inference)
This notebook is set up for inference using a pre-trained VITON-HD model. It demonstrates how to use the model to generate high-resolution virtual try-on results on new images.

ðŸ”® Future Scope
The foundation we've built is immensely powerful, and the road ahead is thrilling.

Hyper-Personalization: We plan to introduce persistent user profiles to learn individual tastes and provide an AI stylist that can recommend complete outfits.

The Leap to 3D and Video: The next frontier is moving from static 2D images to dynamic 3D avatars and real-time video try-on for a fully immersive experience.

From AI Design to Your Doorstep: The ultimate ambition is to partner with print-on-demand services, allowing users to manufacture and purchase their unique AI-generated clothing designs.

This project has laid the groundwork for a future where fashion is not just consumed, but co-created. The technologies are in place, and the possibilities are as limitless as the human imagination.
